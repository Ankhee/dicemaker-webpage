## DiceMaker quick start guide

Hey, thanks for checking out DiceMaker!

This short tutorial is meant to explain the features of the tool. We'll start a new project, customize a die, and finally export it for your 3D printer.

### Interface

When you first open DiceMaker, you'll see an empty scene with two side panels. Left panel lets you manipulate the whole project - add dice, change project-wide font settings, save, load, export the project, and so on. Right panel lets you change die- or face-specific parameters, like die size, engraving position, custom graphics, and so on.

Let's start by adding the first die to the scene. Select the "Add" button, then select the type of die you wish to add. Here, we've added a D20.
